## Getting Started

This repository contains a project by https://github.com/amir650/BlackWidow-Chess that I'm using to learn Java.

For the video lessons please refer to https://github.com/amir650/BlackWidow-Chess

This repository is public just to allow the SonarQube analysis.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
